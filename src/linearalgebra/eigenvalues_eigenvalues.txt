The best explanation of EigenVectors and EigenValues

EigenVectors
============
A set of vectors that do not change direction even after the transformation is applied. The vector
along the axis of a rotation transformation would never change direction. So EigenVectors are
effectively the *axises* of the transformation. 

EigenValues
===========
A set of values that show the amount of 'strech' on each eigenvector axis applied by the transformation.

EigenVectors and EigenValues are for revealing the long term trends of the transformation.
If a transform matrix applies to a matrix infinite times(or after many iterations), the 
applied matrix would revals the *long term trends*.

Zombies apocalypse Survival Example
===================================
Everyday 20% of human population turns to zombies because of zombies attacks.
Everyday 10% of zombies population turns back to human because of vaccines.

                      Humans  --- 20% ---> Zombies
                      Human  <--- 10% ---  Zombies
Days: n = 1....infinite
H(n) = 0.8H(n-1) + 0.1Z(n-1)
Z(n) = 0.2H(n-1) + 0.9Z(n-1)

|H(n)|   | 0.8 0.1 | |H(n-1)|
|    | = |         | |      |
|Z(n)|   | 0.2 0.9 | |Z(n-1)|

The eigenvectors reveals the equilibrium of the system and if the population size of both stay
on the eigenvectors, the then the proportion between the popluation of Humans and Zombies will 
never changes. If the eigenvalues is 1, then the population size of each would remain unchanged
over time.

Graph where Zombies population is on Y axis and Human population is on X axis.
However if the population size of Zombies is way more than Humans, effectively *above* the 
equilibrium/eigenvectors, then humans is going to extinct. But if the population size of humans
is way more than Zombies, effectively *below* the equilibrium/eigenvectors, then zombies are going
to disappear over time.


Page Ranking Probabilities Trends Example
=========================================
Consider the following graph:
Site A ---> Site B
Site B ---> Site C, Site D
Site C ---> Site A, Site D
Site D ---> Site A, Site B

Tracking the number of times of visits, then we can come up a probabilities matrix
     A   B   C   D
A  0.0 0.0 0.5 0.5
B  1.0 0.0 0.0 0.5
C  0.0 0.5 0.0 0.0
D  0.0 0.5 0.5 0.0

EigenVector
| 0.217 |
| 0.348 |
| 0.174 |
| 0.261 |

The eigenvector of this matrix would reveal the long term probabilities of each site being 
visited.
